      <h3>üç∏ Why I Built This</h3>
      <p>
        This app was built as a final project for the React Bootcamp by Code The
        Dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a tribute to my time spent (and still spending) bartending, and is
        a fusion of my passions: building software and crafting cocktails.
      </p>
